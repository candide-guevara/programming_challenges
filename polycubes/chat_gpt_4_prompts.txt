Do you know what the counting 3D polycubes problem is?

Can you write a python program to count the number of possible 3D polycubes for any number of individual cubes? Use numpy to make the counting as fast as possible.

The program you provided returns 15 for the number of possible 3D polycubes composed of 3 individual cubes. However the correct answer should be 2 if you remove duplicates by rotation or translation according to the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycube. Can you correct the python program to produce the right result?

The program is correct now. However it takes more that one minute to count the polycubes up to 8. Can you optimize the program to make it faster? You can for example try to use numpy to replace python list comprehensions where possible. You may also try to use a more efficient data representation.

The program you provided returns 18 for the number of possible 3D polycubes composed of 4 individual cubes. However the correct answer should be 8 if you remove duplicates by rotation or translation according to the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycube. Can you correct the python program to produce the right result?

The program provides the right result for 4 but fails for 5 and all subsequent numbers. Can you correct the python program to produce the right result?

The new program version you proposed is worse. It does not deduplicate all polycubes. For example count_unique_polycubes(5) should be 29 not 534. Can you correct it? You may check your answers for the following examples:
* count_unique_polycubes(4) is 8
* count_unique_polycubes(5) is 29
* count_unique_polycubes(6) is 166

> The attempt to correct the program and optimize it for counting unique 3D polycubes has led to a computational process that is too intensive for real-time execution in this environment, especially as the number of cubes increases. The complexity of generating all rotations and translating them to a canonical form, combined with the need to deduplicate effectively, has resulted in a process that exceeds the practical execution time limits here.
