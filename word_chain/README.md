# Ruby word chains

To take Ruby for a spin I wrote this small [code kata][1]. The goal is to take 2 words
of equal length make a chain between the 2 changing one letter at a time. Example:  
  lead -> load -> goad -> gold

My solution works but is painfully slow. Also the solver seems to have more trouble depending
on the other of words : monkey -> mister is way faster than mister -> monkey

## Getting started

* Uncompress the dictionary english\_words.bz2
* ruby tests.rb -v : runs the test suite
* Edit main.rb to add the words to chain and run it
